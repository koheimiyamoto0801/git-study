# Git Study

- git add: to add some edition to the repository
	- so called "staging"
- git commit: to commit the edition added to the index
	- git commit -m "message"
- git push: to reflect the commit in the local repository to remote
	- git push "remote repository(=origin) branch-name"

## How git works

- "pull" files from remote repository to local 
- edit files there (working tree)
- "add" to index (so called staging) 
- "commit" to finalize the edition sort of
- "push" to reflect the edition to the remote repository from local
